## Notes on optimizations
This implementation supports several optimizations that may be enabled or disabled by passing along flags to the functions described in the [main documentation](README.md). This allows tests to be performed both with and without optimizations enabled. In particular, you may set:

- <code>opt_process_composite_factors</code> to one of the below three options:

   - <code>OptProcessCompositeFactors.JOINTLY_MOD_N</code>

      The solver selects $x$ (denoted $x_j$ in [[E21b]](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11128-021-03069-1)) uniformly at random from $\mathbb Z_N^*$. It then exponentiates $x$ modulo $N$.

      This is how the unoptimized algorithm is described in Section 3.2 of [[E21b]](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11128-021-03069-1).

   - <code>OptProcessCompositeFactors.JOINTLY_MOD_Np</code>

      The solver selects $x$ uniformly at random from $\mathbb Z_{N'}^*$. It then exponentiates $x$ modulo $N^{\prime}$.

      Above $N^{\prime}$ is the product of all pairwise coprime composite factors of $N$ currently stored in the factor collection.

   - <code>OptProcessCompositeFactors.SEPARATELY_MOD_Np</code> (default option)

      The solver selects $x$ uniformly at random from $\mathbb Z_{N'}^*$, for $N^{\prime}$ the product of all pairwise coprime composite factors of $N$ currently stored in the factor collection.
      The solver then exponentiates $x$ modulo $N^{\prime}$ where $N^{\prime}$ now runs over all pairwise coprime composite factors of $N$ currently stored in the factor collection. This is the default option.

   Note that all three options are equivalent with respect to their ability to find non-trivial factors of $N$. The options differ only in terms of their arithmetic complexity. Although several exponentiations may be required when the default option is used, this fact is, in general, more than compensated for by the fact that the moduli are smaller, leading the default option to outperform the other two options.

   This optimization is described in Section 3.2.1 of [[E21b]](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11128-021-03069-1).

- <code>opt_split_factors_with_multiplicity</code> to either <code>True</code> (default option) or <code>False</code>

   When set to <code>True</code>, as is the default, the solver initially tests if $\gcd(r, N)$ yields a non-trivial factor of $N$. If so, the non-trivial factor is reported. When set to <code>False</code>, the aforementioned test is not performed.

   To understand the test, note that if $p^e$ divides $N$, for $e > 1$ an integer and $p$ a large prime, then $p^{e-1}$ is likely to also divide $r$. Note furthermore that it is relatively inexpensive to split $N$ by computing $\gcd(r, N)$, compared to exponentiating modulo $N$.

   For random $N$ void of small factors, it is very unlikely for prime factors to occur with multiplicity. For such $N$, this optimization is hence not of any practical use. It is only if $N$ is likely to have factors that occur with multiplicity, for some special reason, that this optimization is useful in practice. This optimization may also yield non-trivial factors if $N$ has small factors. However, such factors would typically first be removed, e.g. by trial division, before calling upon these more elaborate factoring techniques.

   Note that for $N$ as in the problem instances setup in Appendix A.3 of [[E21b]](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11128-021-03069-1), prime factors are intentionally forced to occur with multiplicity with high probability (when $e_{\max} > 1$). This so as to test that such special cases are handled correctly by the solver. For such $N$, this optimization is likely to report non-trivial factors. This served as our rationale for including it as an option.

   This optimization is described in earlier works in the literature, see for instance [[GLMS15]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.04385.pdf).

- <code>opt_report_accidental_factors</code> to either <code>True</code> (default option) or <code>False</code>

   When set to <code>True</code>, as is the default, the solver reports non-trivial factors of $N$ found "by accident" when sampling $x$ (denoted $x_j$ in [[E21b]](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11128-021-03069-1)) uniformly at random from $\mathbb Z_{N'}^*$, for $N^\prime$ equal to $N$, or to the product of all pairwise coprime composite factors of $N$ in the factor collection, depending on which option is selected for the <code>opt_process_composite_factors</code> flag. When set to <code>False</code>, such non-trivial factors are not reported.

   Note that it is very unlikely for non-trivial factors to be found by accident if $N$ is void of small prime factors. It is only if small factors of $N$ are not first removed, e.g. by trial division, that factors are likely to be found by accident. On the other hand, if we do find factors by accident, it is only logical to report them. This served as our rationale for including this optimization as an option.

   Note furthermore that if $N$ has small factors when this optimization is enabled, and if the <code>opt_process_composite_factors</code> flag is furthermore set to <code>OptProcessCompositeFactors.JOINTLY_MOD_N</code>, then the same non-trivial factor of $N$ may be repeatedly found by accident when sampling. This may generate long printouts.

   Also note that factors that are found "by accident" when sampling $g$ uniformly at random from $\mathbb Z_{N}^*$ are not reported even if <code>opt_report_accidental_factors</code> is set to <code>True</code>. This is because such factors, if found in practice, would typically affect for which $N$ order finding is performed in the first place.

- <code>opt_abort_early</code> to either <code>True</code> (default option) or <code>False</code>

   When set to <code>True</code>, as is the default, the solver computes $x^{2^i o}$ for $i = 0, 1, \ldots, \min(s, t)$, for $t$ as in [[E21b]](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11128-021-03069-1) and $s$ the least non-negative integer such that $x^{2^s o} = 1$. When set to <code>False</code>, the solver instead computes $x^{2^i o}$ for $i = 0, 1, \ldots, t$.

   Note that when the <code>opt_square</code> flag (see below) is set to <code>True</code>, the solver first computes $x^{o}$. It then takes consecutive squares to form $x^{2^i o}$ for each $i$. It follows that the saving incurred by this optimization is fairly minor when the <code>opt_square</code> flag is set to <code>True</code>, as it is trivial to square one. It is only if the <code>opt_square</code> flag is set to <code>False</code> that the saving is substantial.

- <code>opt_square</code> to either <code>True</code> (default option) or <code>False</code>

   When set to <code>True</code>, as is the default, the solver first computes $x^o$. It then takes consecutive squares to form $x^{2^i o}$ for each $i$. When set to <code>False</code>, the solver na√Øvely computes $x^{2^i o}$ from scratch for each $i$.

   This optimization is described in Section 3.2.1 of [[E21b]](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11128-021-03069-1).

- <code>opt_exclude_one</code> to either <code>True</code> (default option) or <code>False</code>

   When set to <code>False</code>, the solver selects $g$ and $x$ (denoted $x_j$ in [[E21b]](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11128-021-03069-1)) uniformly at random from $\mathbb Z_N^*$ and $\mathbb Z_{N'}^*$, respectively, for $N^\prime$ equal to $N$, or to the product of all pairwise coprime composite factors of $N$ in the factor collection, depending on which option is selected for the <code>opt_process_composite_factors</code> flag.
   When set to <code>True</code>, as is the default, the solver excludes one by instead selecting $g$ and $x$ uniformly at random from $\mathbb Z_{N}^* \backslash \{ 1 \}$ and $\mathbb Z_{N'}^* \backslash \{ 1 \}$, respectively.

   This optimization is described in Section 3.2.1 of [[E21b]](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11128-021-03069-1).
